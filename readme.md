      6. Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples 
           of languages that fall under each category.


           1. We call a language “statically-typed” if it follows type checking during compilation. So, every detail about the variables and all the data types must be known before we do the compiling process. examples are Java, C, C++, C#, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Pascal, Rust,


           2. We call a language “dynamically typed” if type checking takes place while the program runs (run-time). In this type of language, there is no need to specify the data type of each variable while writing code. Some examples of dynamically-typed languages are Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, R, Dart, Lua, Objective-C, etc.

In this type of language, once a variable is assigned a type, it can’t be assigned to some other variable of a different type. 

      7. Differentiate between the JavaScript data types �null� and �undefined

          1- Undefined means a variable that has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been assigned.
 
          2- A null means the absence of a value. You assign a null to a variable with the intention that currently this variable does not have any value but it will have later on. It is like a placeholder for a value. The type of null is the object.
